## Project Description:

For this exercise, I was tasked with creating a multiple-choice quiz on JavaScript. The quiz is built with HTML and CSS and dynamically powered using JavaScript.

Once the quiz is over, the user can save his/her score and the data gets stored in localStorage and displayed on a "View High Scores" page.

Quiz features:
- Timer that counts down from 75 seconds
- Correct answers increase the score by 10 points
- Incorrect answers decrease the timer by 10 seconds
- Quiz is over when time is up or no more questions left
- User can enter his/her name and save score
- User can view all high scores saved on localStorage
- Application is responsive to multiple screen sizes
